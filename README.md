## Overview

CrestCode brings the feel of a desktop IDE to Android devices. It combines a touch-optimized Monaco editor, a Linux-based development environment, and a native Compose interface to provide a fast, flexible, and familiar coding experience for mobile development.

This project aims to make coding on Android feel less like a compromise and more like a proper workspace: multi-tab editing, terminal access, filesystem tools, settings management, and developer workflows that work well on smaller screens.

## Key Features

### Desktop-grade code editor
- Monaco editor with VS Code-style editing behavior
- Touch-aware selection and interaction model for mobile screens
- Floating actions for copy, paste, select all, and editing shortcuts
- Keyboard-friendly workflow with support for common developer actions

### Linux development environment
- PRoot-based sandbox for running Linux tooling on Android
- Built-in terminal for shell workflows and project tasks
- Support for common developer runtimes and command-line tools
- Workspace access for local files and project folders

### Android-native experience
- Jetpack Compose UI designed for mobile workflows
- Multi-tab workspace layout
- Settings screen inspired by VS Code preferences
- Auto-save and dirty state tracking for editing reliability

### VS Code-style configuration
- JSON-based settings management
- Reactive configuration updates
- A familiar editor experience for users coming from desktop IDEs

## Configuration Reference

The project uses a `settings.json`-style configuration layer for editor behavior and runtime preferences.

| Setting key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `files.autoSave` | `string` | `afterDelay` | Save mode for dirty files |
| `files.autoSaveDelay` | `number` | `1000` | Delay before auto-save in milliseconds |
| `files.showHiddenFiles` | `boolean` | `false` | Show dotfiles in workspace view |
| `editor.fontSize` | `number` | `14` | Editor font size |
| `editor.tabSize` | `number` | `4` | Number of spaces per tab |
| `editor.wordWrap` | `string` | `on` | Word wrap mode |
| `editor.minimap.enabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Toggle minimap |
| `editor.theme` | `string` | `vs-dark` | Editor color theme |
| `terminal.integrated.fontSize` | `number` | `13` | Terminal font size |

## Requirements

- Android SDK with compile support for SDK 34
- Minimum Android SDK: 26
- JDK 17 or newer
- Node.js 18+ for editor-core build steps
- Arm64 target support for native runtime components

## Build and Run

### Build Monaco editor core

```bash
cd editor-core
npm install
node ./node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js build
```

This generates the editor assets used by the Android app.

### Build the Android app

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The produced APK is typically located under:
